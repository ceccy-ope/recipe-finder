# recipe finder
 I created a recipe finder site where you can search for any recipe with the ingredients you have in your refrigerator.
 
 On inputing your ingredients, various dishes you can create with the ingredient are displayed.

 You then click on get recipe to get the ingredient and preparation details of the particular dish.
 
 I used themealdb API for the recipes.
 
 I'm glad I was able to strengthen my API fetching muscles through this project, thanks to Mr Phillip who challenged us to try it.
 
 still learning though
